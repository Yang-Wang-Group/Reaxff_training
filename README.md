# An Improved Reactive Force Field Parameter Optimization Framework Based on Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms

This package combined the Simulated Annealing algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to optimize the Reactive Force Field, besides, we introduced a concentrated attention mechanism to 
improve accuracy.
This work is completed using C language.
